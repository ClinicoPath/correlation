\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe.}

\item{data2}{An optional dataframe.}

\item{method}{A character string indicating which correlation coefficient is to be used for the test. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman", "biserial", "polychoric", "tetrachoric", "biweight", "distance" or "percentage" (for percentage bend correlation). Setting "auto" will attempt at selecting the most relevant method (polychoric when ordinal factors involved, tetrachoric when dichotomous factors involved, point-biserial if one dichotomous and one continuous and pearson otherwise).}

\item{p_adjust}{Correction method for frequentist correlations. Can be one of "holm" (default), "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr" or "none".}

\item{ci}{Confidence/Credible Interval level. If "default", then 0.95 for Frequentist and 0.89 for Bayesian (see documentation in the \pkg{bayestestR} package).}

\item{bayesian}{If TRUE, will run the correlations under a Bayesian framework Note that for partial correlations, you will also need to set \code{partial_bayesian} to \code{TRUE} to obtain "full" Bayesian partial correlations. Otherwise, you will obtain pseudo-Bayesian partial correlations (i.e., Bayesian correlation based on frequentist partialization).}

\item{bayesian_prior}{For the prior argument, several named values are recognized: "medium.narrow", "medium", "wide", and "ultrawide". These correspond to scale values of 1/sqrt(27), 1/3, 1/sqrt(3) and 1, respectively. See the \code{BayesFactor::correlationBF} function.}

\item{bayesian_ci_method}{See arguments in \code{\link[=parameters]{model_parameters}} for \code{BayesFactor} tests.}

\item{bayesian_test}{See arguments in \code{\link[=parameters]{model_parameters}} for \code{BayesFactor} tests.}

\item{redundant}{Shoud the data include redundant rows (where each given correlation is repeated two times).}

\item{include_factors}{If \code{TRUE}, the factors are kept and eventually converted to numeric or used as random effects (depending of \code{multilevel}). If \code{FALSE}, factors are removed upfront.}

\item{partial}{Can be TRUE or "semi" for partial and semi-partial correlations, respectively. This only works for Frequentist correlations.}

\item{partial_bayesian}{If TRUE, will run the correlations under a Bayesian framework Note that for partial correlations, you will also need to set \code{partial_bayesian} to \code{TRUE} to obtain "full" Bayesian partial correlations. Otherwise, you will obtain pseudo-Bayesian partial correlations (i.e., Bayesian correlation based on frequentist partialization).}

\item{multilevel}{If \code{TRUE}, the factors are included as random factors. If \code{FALSE} (default), factors are binarized (dummified) and partialized out in the same than the other numeric variables.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
