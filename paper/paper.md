# Introduction

Correlations tests are arguably one of the most commonly used statistical procedures, and are used as a basis in many applications such as exploratory data analysis, structural modeling, data engineering etc. **correlation** is an R package [@Rteam] package, from the [**easystats**](https://github.com/easystats/easystats) collection, focused on correlation analysis. It's lightweight, easy to use, and allows for the computation of many different kinds of correlations, such as:

- **Pearson's correlation**: The covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations.

- **Spearman's rank correlation**: A nonparametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not).

- **Kendall's rank correlation**: In the normal case, the Kendall correlation is preferred than the Spearman correlation because of a smaller gross error sensitivity (GES) and a smaller asymptotic variance (AV), making it more robust and more efficient. However, the interpretation of Kendall's tau is less direct than that of Spearman's rho, in the sense that it quantifies the difference between the % of concordant and discordant pairs among all possible pairwise events.

- **Biweight midcorrelation**: A measure of similarity between samples that is median-based, rather than mean-based, thus is less sensitive to outliers, and can be a robust alternative to other similarity metrics, such as Pearson correlation.

- **Distance correlation**: Distance correlation measures both linear and nonlinear association between two random variables or random vectors. This is in contrast to Pearson's correlation, which can only detect linear association between two random variables.

- **Percentage bend correlation**: Introduced by Wilcox (1994), it is based on a down-weight of a specified percentage of marginal observations deviating from the median (by default, 20%).

- **Shepherd's Pi correlation**: Equivalent to a Spearman's rank correlation after outliers removal (by means of bootstrapped mahalanobis distance).

- **Point-Biserial and biserial correlation**: Correlation coefficient used when one variable is continuous and the other is dichotomous (binary). Point-serial is equivalent to a Pearson's correlation, while Biserial should be used when the binary variable is assumed to have an underlying continuity. For example, anxiety level can be measured on a continuous scale, but can be classified dichotomously as high/low.

- **Polychoric correlation**: Correlation between two theorised normally distributed continuous latent variables, from two observed ordinal variables.

- **Tetrachoric correlation**: Special case of the polychoric correlation applicable when both observed variables are dichotomous.

- **Partial correlation**: something

- **Multilevel correlation**: something

# Design


It relies on one main function, `correlation()`, which outputs a dataframe containing each pairwise correlation per row. This long format is convenient for further data analysis, but not as much to get a summary, which is usually obtained via a correlation matrix. To address this, we added standard methods, such as `summary()` and `as.table()`, to automatically transform the long output to a matrix. Moreover, **correlation** also include plotting capabilities via the [**see** package](https://easystats.github.io/see/) [@ludecke2019see].
